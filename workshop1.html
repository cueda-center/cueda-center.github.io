                            <div>Edge computing has emerged as a formidable paradigm that brings data processing and
                                analysis closer to where data originates, enabling real-time insights, reduced latency,
                                and improved privacy. This goal necessitates infusing more intelligence into edge
                                devices. However, the success of contemporary Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies,
                                such as deep neural networks (DNNs), is largely dependent on the upscaling of the model
                                size. This trend is at odds with the highly restricted computational resources of edge
                                devices, which are usually constrained by size, cost, and energy consumption
                                limitations. In this presentation, we discuss the challenges and emerging trends of
                                AI-fueled modern edge computing system design, covering aspects like efficiency,
                                resiliency, security, heterogeneity, and scalability. We also present our vision for
                                actualizing “Big AI for Small Devices”.</div>

                            <div>Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is a technique that varies the system's operating voltage
                                and hence clock frequency based on the computation demand in order to achieve power and
                                energy efficiency. It has been adopted by today's computing and communication devices,
                                from smartphones and mobile sensors to data centers and cloud servers. In this talk, I
                                will share our research experiences and results on DVS in the past 25+ years. I will
                                start with a description of the essence of DVS in trading execution speed (or complete
                                time) for power and energy saving. Then I will present the theoretical framework and
                                practical solutions for DVS-enabled systems. In the second half, we will switch to the
                                security aspect, where I will discuss the security vulnerabilities associated with DVS,
                                highlighting our VoltJockey attacks that have successfully broken the trusted execution
                                environment provided by ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX, and Nvidia GPU Cloud. I will also
                                report our recent works on leveraging DVS to enhance the security of devices and machine
                                learning models. The talk concludes with a short summary on the lessons we have learned
                                in the development and implementation of DVS. </div>

                            <div>Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRA) are programmable, domain-agnostic
                                accelerators that can be morphed and instantiated into specialized accelerators
                                on-the-fly via software. They offer ASIC-like efficiency while promising high
                                adaptability through compile-time reconfiguration. The central challenge is the
                                efficient spatio-temporal mapping of applications expressed in high-level programming
                                languages to the accelerator. Unfortunately, unlike FPGA, the CGRA design tools are in
                                their infancy. In this talk, I will present Morpher, an open-source end-to-end
                                compilation, simulation, and validation framework crafted to assist design space
                                exploration and application-level development of CGRA-based systems. At the heart of
                                Morpher is an innovative portable and scalable compiler. This compiler can synthesize
                                complex application kernels onto any user-specified CGRA architecture through a
                                Graph-Neural Network (GNN) based approach coupled with hierarchical mapping
                                abstractions. Thus it can produce superior quality mapping in just a fraction of the
                                compilation time compared to state-of-the-art techniques. We believe Morpher will act as
                                a catalyst, pushing forward the boundaries of CGRA innovations.</div>

                            <div>This talk aims at introducing the multi-grained re-configurable computing platforms
                                which are elastic in both of space and time domains. It is expected to explore the
                                disruptive computer architectures for ultra-high speed, low cost, and flexible tensor
                                computations without any benefitting of Moore's Law. For this purpose, (1) the
                                multi-grained re-configurable architecture is developed on the basis of our novel neural
                                network topology seen as "DiaNet" (addressing space-elastic); (2) an innovative
                                mechanism for data processing is explored by the snapshot (or accumulative, optionally)
                                observation of spiking (addressing time-elastic). By merging (1) and (2), arbitrary
                                complex AI tasks can be migrated onto our platforms with any specific speed-quality
                                constraints, which can even be within one clock cycle (seen as "flash computing"). For
                                powering ubiquitous computations, the conventional trade-off among the performance,
                                speed, cost is expected to be broken through.
